# Hetergeneous Evaluation using K-Means Clustering
This repository contains all the code used to run k-means in several configurations.

## Configurations
Below are explanations of the configurations for each directory

### Serial
The [serial](./serial) confiuration allows to run k-means without any concurrent processing. On my own machine, a runtime for 100 observations takes ~2.7 ms. 

### MPI
*not yet implemented*

### 50-50
*not yet implemented*

### CUDA
